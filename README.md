# Welcome to the repository of both RE:All About Engie and EngieLib!
## To PROPERLY report issues for either mod, PLEASE use their proper labels.
### EngieLib updates can be found under the releases page!
### If you're having difficulties trying to install the mods, you can look it up.
## If you want to find the resourcepack compatibility for EngieLib and RE:All About Engie do the following:
### Change the branch to "Resourcepacks" and find the right resourcepack for the compatibility, the name of the resourcepack *should* tell you what it is.
### THE COMPATIBILITY RESOURCEPACKS WILL NOT BE UPLOADED TO CURSEFORGE.
## Code
### The uploading of the code for both mods is broken currently so if I can find a fix I'll be happy for once.
