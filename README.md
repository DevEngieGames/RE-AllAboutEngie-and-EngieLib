# Welcome to the Resourcepacks branch of both RE:All About Engie and EngieLib!
## THE COMPATIBILITY RESOURCEPACKS WILL NOT BE UPLOADED TO ANY PLATFORM.
### If you're having issues on figuring out on how to install these here's a guide.

## Standard Minecraft:
- ### Open File Explorer and navigate to your minecraft installation.
  - ### If you do not know how to get there then open up the Minecraft Launcher, go to the Installations tab under MINECRAFT: JAVA EDITION, hover over an instance, and click the folder icon on the right(It's next to the "Play" button.).
- ### Open up your "resourcepacks" folder.
  - ## If you do not have this folder, create it.
- ### Download the resourcepack that you want by clicking on the file name here on GitHub, and then clicking the download button.
- ### If you can chose where to save the file, copy the path to your "resourcepacks" folder and save it to there.
- ### If not, open another tab of File Explorer to where the file was downloaded, and then drag it into the "resourcepacks" folder.

## Modrinth:
- ### Download the resourcepack that you want by clicking on the file name here on GitHub, and then clicking the download button.
- ### Drag the pack from wherever you saved the file into your modrinth modpack of your choice that has the mod installed.

## CurseForge:
- ### Got no idea, you might have to drop the pack in as an override..
